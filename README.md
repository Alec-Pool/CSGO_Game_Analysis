# CSGO_Game_Analysis

This is a Python project that me and a colleague did to analyze data on the game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

Created using data from https://www.kaggle.com/skihikingkevin/csgo-matchmaking-damage

Dataset omitted from this github repository as the files exceeded maximum size limit. Relevant files for running the .ipynb are mm_master_demos.csv, mm_grenades_demos.csv, map_data.csv, and the map PNGs.
